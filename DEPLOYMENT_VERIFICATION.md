## 🚀 Deployed Components

### ✅ Supabase Edge Functions (Secure Backend)
- **`analyze-petition`** - GPT-4 powered legal claim extraction
- **`evaluate-evidence`** - AI-driven evidence quality assessment  
- **`upload-petition`** - Secure file processing and storage
- **`test-openai`** - Connection verification and health checks

### ✅ Security Features
- 🔐 **OpenAI API Key**: Secured in Supabase environment variables
- 🛡️ **End-to-End Encryption**: All data transfers encrypted
- 📝 **Audit Logging**: Complete processing trails
- 🚫 **No Frontend Exposure**: Zero sensitive data in client
- ⚡ **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
- 🔍 **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization

### ✅ AI Capabilities
- **Legal Claim Extraction**: Identifies assault, negligence, procedural violations
- **Confidence Scoring**: 0.0-1.0 accuracy ratings for each claim
- **Evidence Evaluation**: 8-point quality assessment criteria
- **Timeline Generation**: Chronological event extraction
- **Risk Assessment**: Severity and priority classification
- **Recommendations**: Actionable insights for officers

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Connect Supabase (Required)
Click the **"Connect to Supabase"** button in the top right corner to:
- Link your Supabase project
- Auto-deploy edge functions
- Configure database connection

### 2. Add OpenAI API Key (Required)
In your Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Edge Functions** → **Environment Variables**
2. Add: `OPENAI_API_KEY` = `your-openai-api-key-here`
3. Save and redeploy functions

### 3. Verify Connection
Use the **Connection Status** component to verify:
- ✅ Supabase Database Connected
- ✅ Edge Functions Deployed  
- ✅ OpenAI API Accessible

## 🎯 How It Works

### Petition Processing Flow
1. **Upload**: File encrypted and stored securely
2. **Extract**: Text content parsed from PDF/DOCX/TXT
3. **Analyze**: GPT-4 processes content on backend
4. **Store**: Results saved with audit trail
5. **Display**: Structured data shown in frontend

### Evidence Evaluation Flow
1. **Submit**: Evidence description sent to backend
2. **Process**: AI evaluates using 8 criteria
3. **Score**: Relevance, clarity, completeness, etc.
4. **Recommend**: Improvement suggestions generated
5. **Return**: Comprehensive evaluation data

## 🔒 Security Verification

### ✅ API Key Security
- OpenAI key stored in Supabase environment (never in frontend)
- Accessed only by edge functions on secure servers
